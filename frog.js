// A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. 
// The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

// Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

// Write a function:

// function solution(X, Y, D);

// that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

// For example, given:

//   X = 10
//   D = 30
//   Y = 85
// the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

// after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
// after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
// after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

// X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
// X â‰¤ Y.

// half a second average on very small numbers

    if (X == Y) return 0 // doesn't have to jump
    if (D == Y) return 1 // would take one step 
    let difference = Y - D // calculate the distance left to reach the target Y
    let K = difference / D // calculate how many to add to D to reach Y
    let B = difference / Y // calculate how many steps to reach Y from the difference
